**Project Name:** Closest Pair of Points Problem Using Divide and Conquer Method

**Project Goal:** 

1. For a given set of N points on a plane, find the shortest distance among all pairs of points, i.e., the input is N points on a plane, and the output is the two points among these N points that are closest to each other.
2. Randomly generate N points' plane coordinates and apply the brute-force method to compute the shortest distance among all pairs of points.
3. Randomly generate N points' plane coordinates and use the divide and conquer method to compute the shortest distance among all pairs of points.
4. For N ranging from 100,000 to 1,000,000, record the running time of the algorithm, compare the theoretical efficiency with the empirical efficiency, and analyze and compare the algorithmic efficiency of both brute-force and divide and conquer methods.
5. Extra credit will be awarded if the algorithm execution process can be visualized using a graphical interface.
