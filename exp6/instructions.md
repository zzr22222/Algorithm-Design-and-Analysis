**Project Name:** Maximum Flow Problem in Graphs



**Project Goal:** 

1. There are *m* papers and *n* reviewers, with each paper needing *a* reviewers, and each reviewer can review at most *b* papers. Please design a paper assignment scheme.

2. Use the maximum flow algorithm to solve the above problem. Draw a flow network diagram for *m*=10 and n*=3, and explain the relationship between the flow network diagram and the paper review problem.
3. Implement the designed algorithm in a programming language, and calculate the assignment schemes for different values of *a* and *b*. If there is no feasible solution, output that there is no solution.
