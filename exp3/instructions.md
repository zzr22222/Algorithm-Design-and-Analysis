**Project Name:** Map Coloring Problem Using Backtracking Method

**Project Goal:** 

1. For the following small-scale data, use four colors to test the correctness of the algorithm:

   ![Map Coloring, a fictional map is given showing the states of a country.  Represent the map by a graph and find a coloring of the graph, using the  minimum number of colors](file:////Users/zhaozirui/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.jpg)

2. Apply coloring to the map data provided in the attachment.

3. Randomly generate maps of different scales and analyze the relationship between the algorithm's efficiency and the scale of the map (using four colors).
