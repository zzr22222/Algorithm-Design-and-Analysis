**Project Name:** Solving the Gold Pot Game Problem Using Dynamic Programming

**Project Goal:** 

In the Gold Pot Game, there are two players, A and B. All gold pots are arranged in a row, and each pot contains a certain number of gold coins. Players can see how many coins are in each gold pot. Players A and B take turns opening the gold pots, but they must start from one end of the row. A player can choose to open a pot from either end of the row. The winner is the player who ends up with more coins. We are player A, and the goal is to maximize the number of coins collected by A.

1. Provide the dynamic programming equation to solve the problem.
2. Randomly generate the number of gold pots and the value of coins in them. Use the brute-force method to test the correctness of the algorithm on small data models, and record which gold pot A chooses.
3. Randomly generate the number of gold pots and the value of coins in them. Test the efficiency of the algorithm with different data scales (values of n) and compare it with the theoretical efficiency. Please provide the maximum data scale that can be handled, ensuring it is processed within a reasonable time frame.
4. Is there room for efficiency improvement in this algorithm, including space and time efficiency?
